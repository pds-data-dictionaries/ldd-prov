The **Provenance (`prov`) namespace** provides an implementation of the **W3C PROV-DM standard** to document and preserve the history, context, and authenticity of digital objects.  

The implementation is designed to be general, enabling it to capture various types of provenance within the **PDS**. Specific classes are defined and exposed for targeted use cases.  

Currently, these use cases include:  

- **LID supersession** (`SupersededLID`)
