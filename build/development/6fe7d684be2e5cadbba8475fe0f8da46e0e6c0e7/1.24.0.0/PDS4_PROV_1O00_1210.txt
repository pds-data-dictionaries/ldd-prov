    The purpose of the 'prov' LDD is to provide a PDS4 'Discipline_Area' insert for capturing provenance information. The 'prov' LDD is an implementation of the W3C PROV Data Model (PROV-DM).
    Provenance refers to information about the entities, activities, and people involved in producing a piece of data or artifact. Such information can be used to evaluate its quality, reliability, and trustworthiness. PROV-DM is the conceptual data model that underpins the W3C PROV family of specifications.

    The LDD is designed to support the creation of classes for specific types of PDS provenance.
    
    1) SupersededLID - This class establishes a relationship between two LIDs, identifying one as having been superseded by another. It is an exposed class intended for use as an insert into the 'Discipline_Area' of a PDS4 label.
